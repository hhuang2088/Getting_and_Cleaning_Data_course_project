You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Good luck!

##Overview
 The purpose of this project is to learn how to obtain and clean data. This
 repo contains a single R script, run_anaylsis, which uses data from the UC
 Irvine's Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, I merge the
 information into a variable, data. When the script is run, it also creates,
 a tidydata.txt file that contains the averages of the "subject" and "activity"
 variables from the data.
